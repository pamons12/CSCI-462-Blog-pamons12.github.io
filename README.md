### Introduction
Welcome to my blog.
<br/> I am a senior at the College of Charleston and am pursuing a BS in Computer Science.

### Reflections on FOSS
As of today, my group has been deciding which open-source software we would like to work on throughout this semester. We are meeting later today to make our final decision and to see if we can get this software up and running. Our three candidates are listed below:
1. Tanaguru Contrast Finder
<br/><span style="margin-left:3em">Tanaguru is a project dedicated to enhancing the quality and accessibility of web and digital products. The Tanaguru Contrast Finder is an application designed to run within Tanaguru and helps find contrasting colors that promote design quality and accessibility for visually impaired users. Contrast Finder is mostly coded in Java, which we are all familiar with.
2. Miradi
<br/><span style="margin-left:3em">Miradi is an open-source project management software designed to be used by conservation-based organizations. It helps teams to design, plan, implement, and monitor these organizations' projects. Miradi is also primarily written in Java, which we are all familiar with. 
3. Blockly
<br/><span style="margin-left:3em">Blockly is an open-source project that focuses on teaching kids K-12 computer programming. Rather than typing code out, it uses blocks that piece together like puzzle pieces. Blockly is written in  Javascript, which we have limited knowledge of but would be a good learning experience.
